Changes to do a release and upgrade release number 

 (0) Make sure that there is a pack file for the new release.
     This change needs to be in awb/HEAD and awb/STABLE and
     is a little convoluted when releasing awb...

 (1) Prepare HEAD for a release

     a) Make sure that the following files had been updated to the correct version.
        Note: These numbers DO NOT include a 'v' in them, e.g., 12.01.

          i)   debian/changelog

          ii)  debian/control
     
          iii) debian/rules

     b) Make sure that the following file has been updated to the correct version.
        Note: These numbers DO include a 'v' in them, e.g., v12.01.         
 
         i)   admin/packages/<packagename>  (see Tag= line)

     c) (Optional) Try a debian build and repository update (see instructions below)

     d) Make sure the buildbots are looking for this as the testing release

     e) Commit these changes with 'awb-shell commit' if changes were necessary.


 (2) Create a new branch for release

     a) Update buildbots to look for this version as the new release

     b) Create a branch with:

            % awb-shell branch package <packagename>
              Enter name for branch: v12.01
              Put branch in tags/ instead of branches [no]: no

     c) Change the release name to '+fixes' in the followwing file:
        For example, 11.04+fixes~svn20100724r382+lucid

           i) debian/changelog

     d) Change the 'Prerelease' flag to 0 in:

           i) admin/packages/<packagename>

     d) Commit these changes with 'awb-shell commit'.

     e) (Optional) Try a debian build and repository update (see instructions below)



 (3) Fix the trunk to prepare for the next future release

     a) Change the buildbots to look for the new testing version

     b) Checkout HEAD - BEWARE step (2) changed you to the branch

     c) Update to the next version number as described in step (1) above

     c) Commit these changes with 'awb-shell commit'.



-----------------------------


Build for debian

  1) Update debian/changelog (using dch can help)

     a) For HEAD, name should be <release>.<major>.<minor>~svn<date>r<version>+<release>
        For example, 11.04~svn20100724r382+lucid

        For a release, name should be <release>.<major>.<minor>+fixes~svn<date>r<version>+<release>
        For example, 11.04+fixes~svn20100724r382+lucid

     b) Change date at bottom of changelog

     c) Commit these changes with 'awb-shell commit'.


  2) Build it

     a) % debuild -us -uc
        or
        % debuild -r sudo -us -uc

  3) Copy .deb files created in ../ to system containing repository


Install into repository for distribution

  1) Make sure you are running as user with the gpg key

     a) % sudo bash; su 
             or
        % sudo -H -i

     b) Using gpg-agent is useful

        % eval $(gpg-agent --daemon)


  2) Install <package>.deb (copied above) into repository

     a) % cd <repository-directory>
        For example, /home/asim/reprepro/releases/ubuntu

     b) % reprepro includedeb <release> <package>.deb
