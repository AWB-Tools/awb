=head1 NAME

install-rcfile - install an rcfile

=head1 SYNOPSIS

install-shell [--copy]
              [--mode <chmod-mode>]
              [-D]
              [--help]
	   <source-rcfile> <target-rcfile>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a program that is designed to help with the problem of
re-installing an rcfile, e.g., /etc/asim/asimrc, when the
file has already been changed by the user, and you would like
to keep the users updates, while at the same time removing 
obsolete entries and installing a new rcfile with documentation 
and default values for groups and items that did not previously exist.

This program operates on windows ini file style files that
are used as rcfile configuration files. See Asim::Inifile
for more details.

Assuming we want to update an rcfile /etc/asim/asimrc with the
new version of the rcfile at ./asimrc. The program operates as 
follows:

   % install-rcfile ./asimrc /etc/asim/asimrc

If the target file (/etc/asim/asimrc) does not exist then the
new version (./asimrc) is simply copied to the new file.

If, however, there is already a target file, the following 
alorithm is applied:

  1) Copy the existing asimrc file /etc/asim/asimrc.save

  2) Copy the new asimrc file to /etc/asim/asimrc.default

  3) Create a new asimrc via the following algorithm:

       a) Start with the new rcfile, i.e., ./asimrc

       b) For each entry in this file check if there is a
       correponding entry in previously existing rcfile, i.e.,
       asimrc.save. If so, update the entry with the value 
       from asimrc.save.

       c) Install this as the new rcfile, /etc/asim/asimrc.

The result should be the files /etc/asim/asimrc.save, which contains
the old version of the rcfile, /etc/asim/asimrc.default, which contains
the new default rcfile and /etc/asim/asimrc, which contains the new
version of the rcfile, but with items whose values were not defaulted
in the previous version changed to their previously assigned values.

=head1 SWITCHES

The following command line switches are currently supported:

=over 4 

=item --copy

Switch (-c) for compatibility with standard install programs. 
Does nothing.

=item --mode <chmod-mode>

Set mode of target file to <chmod-mode>.

=item -D

For compatibilty with standard install programs. Does nothing.

=item --help

Get this help information.

=back


=head1 EXAMPLES

=head1 BUGS

User added comments and the file structure of the old rcfile 
are lost, since the new rcfile reflects the stucture of the
new default rcfile.

There is no provision for preserving user added changes when 
the name of a group or an item within a group has changed.

Several switches available on standard install programs are
not implememented.

This program depends on Asim::Inifile, which must be in the
perl library path (or $PERL5LIB).
