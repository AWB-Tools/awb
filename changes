Improve performance of awb on CFX files:
- Add --listflags option fo all CFX files. This lets awb find out whether
a generated CFG file has multiple regions in a single pass instead of
having to invoke the CFX file twice.
- Cache the result of CFX queries for 1 minute in awb. The awb GUI
is constantly probing the CFX file, even with mouse events. The cache
greatly improves performance.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2243)

- For well over a year, the port code has been dynamically allocating
the storage associated with each read port. Since it's now doing it
dynamically (it used to be statically allocated), 2 assertions that
were checking the static size were irrelevant and removed.

Furthermore, there was no longer any need to specify a static size
in any port declaration if the port's bandwidth or latency exceeded
the default static size. So, all of these template parameters were
removed to make the code easier to read and understand.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2254)

- Added the ability to specify command line args in a file,
using the syntax

-cfg <filename>

This arguments file can have one or multiple arguments on a line, or 
comments starting with hash (#),and config files can recursively call
 other config files.

This option should work in --feeder, --system or awb args sections,
or you could have a single file containing both --feeder and --system
sections.

Argument values may contain double-quoted (") sections, and the quote
characters are stripped before further parsing by the simulator, as they
would be in the shell. Thus any arg lists currently in .models files can
be copied verabatim into config files for use with -cfg.

This change was made to the classic controller base class, so any controller
based on it will inherit this feature.

- Fixed the perl Qt search path to look under .../lib64/... on SUSE64 with perl 5.8.7
instead of lib32, since that version of perl seems to be a true 64-bit binary.
- Added a make target "install-src-public" that does the same as "install-sc" but also
makes the installed source tree world-readable.

- look for PerlQt in either .../lib32/... or .../lib64/... depending
on whether you are on x86_64 or not, on SUSE.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2263)

- several additions to the asim build area:
1. added an option to specify the build location. In conjunction with
nobuild option, this can be used to pickup models from an alternate
location. 
2. delineated build and run directories. Resdir can reside in a 
seperate space from the build directory.
3. changed the default model build location of amc to asim-root/build/default.
4. changed default result directory for asim-run from '.' to asim-root/build/default.
5. removed altexepath. Buildarea option is meaningful in both build and nobuild option.

- Remove LAZY_DEST template option from ASIM_MM_CLASS. It was never used
and will get in the way of optimizing the class for multithreading.
- Update the cross-process port methods. For now they use spin locks.
We'll need to add exponential backoff.
- Disable events for multithreaded models. Obviously this will have to
be fixed.
- Fix mismatched malloc/free in args.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2268)

Fix a problem that lead to recursive clearing of the same reference.
When the ref count reached 0 for a pointer being cleared the destructor
was being called before the pointer was cleared. This can lead to
recursive attempts to clear the pointer if the destructor checks the
pointer and tries to clear it. (E.g. Removing an object from a list.)
Changed the code to decrement the ref count, clear the pointer and then
call the destructor if the ref count is 0.

- Added a function "ShiftPath()" to Asim::GenCFG::Auto, to make it easy to
extract parameters passed as part of the virtual path using cfx scripts,
for example:

my/script.cfx/param1/param2/the/rest/of/the/path.cfg

In the cfx script you can now easily extract these parameters:

$param1 = Asim::GenCFG::Auto::ShiftPath();
$param2 = Asim::GenCFG::Auto::ShiftPath();

Leaving "the/rest/of/the/path" to be substituted as @BENCHMARKPATH@.
See "asim-shell help code" on GenCFG::Auto for details.

Updated "single-check-param.cfx" to use this new feature.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2302)

This commit adds support for removing a reference to a
package from the awb search path specified in the awb.config file
(so long as the reference to the package does not result from a
crossproduct {a,b,c} expansion in the search path). This support is
used as part of checkout to ask a user if they want to remove
a reference to a particular package if they are checking out
a package with the same name. This should result in the elimination
of the annoying message about multiple copies of a package after
one checks out simcore and the reference to the public version was 
left in the search path.

Specific changes involved a refactoring of the workspace
search path manipultation code, a new accessor in the repository object
to find the name of the package the repository holds, and some bug
fixes when a workspace contaings no packages.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2292-2294: Joel Emer)

The commit adds support for finding repository .pack files from a
list of places rather than an single file asim.pack. This packfile
path can contain either individual .pack files or directories, in
which case all of the files (matching the pattern *.pack) will be
used. 

The default packfile path is 
$HOME/.asim/repositories.d
$HOME/.asim/asim.pack
<install-dir>/etc/asim/repositories.d
<install-dir>/etc/asim/asim.pack

That list can be overridden in asim-shell on the command line with
the --repositoryDB switch.

A later phase of this process will involve populating the repositories.d
directory.

Joel

Fixed Makefile bug.

added ptv support to dral. this can be enabled with --enable-ptv=yes. this
is off by default.

wrote and debugged new dral/ptv api for ptv-style event instrumentation. you
can now generate ptv logs using coho-bk or x86libs versions of ptlib.

added libnullptlib to be linked in with a ptv-enabled libdral when you do not
want to link in a real ptv library.

fix for asim bug #0000741.

created new "system" modules which have support for the new "dral_api" modules
(ie. version 2). added new "dral_api" modules.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2318 - Brian Slechta)

there is no ANSI compliant way to create var-args on the fly, so I created a
non-portable way to do this. this non-portability broke the SUSE64 build for
libdral. If you compile 32-bit binaries on 64-bit machines, this problem does
not come up.

i disabled all va_list code when --enable-ptv=no. the new dral/ptv api will
not do anything when this flag is enabled until this issue is actually
resolved.

this commit should fix the build on SUSE64 with 64-bit builds.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2323 - Joel Emer)

Added more uniform support for submodels. So in the base
library there is now support for a database of submodels,
i.e., .apm files whose root is not of asim-type "model".
A cache of this database is kept in <AWBLOCAL>/var, like
the module database, so a rehash of that cache is done
with the asim-shell command "rehash models" as well as
will a simple "rehash".

And in apm-edit, the box in the lower left showing
alternative modules lists submodels as alternatives, and
the "refresh" button (the terminology shouldn't be
different) will rehash the submodel cache.

added support for virtual netbatch. the flow has been tested in MMDC using
regular netbatch. the benchmarks are setup in the local workspace. run areas
and executables are rsync'd to the remote area, the runs are sent to netbach
to run in the remote area, and funally the results are then rsync'd back to the
workspace.

i will now test in AN using virtual netbatch options.

Updating with simcore changes rev. 2337 (Brian Slechta)

made changes to asim-run to support a faster local build. namely, i added the
ability to fork each build/setup to its own process to achieve greater
parallelism. make sure you can handle that many builds at once (eg. use
distcc). second, added timestamps and pids to output and logs. third, added
ability to control the distcc "-j" level. this is most useful when you are
parallelizing many builds.

WARNING: this forking is still relatively experimental

new options are (params and asimr variables):

--printtimes!, PRINT_TIMES, defaults to 1
--forklocal!, FORK_LOCAL, defaults to 0
--distccjlevel, DISTCC_JLEVEL, defaults to ""

added header to all three scripts for perl syntax highlighting in emacs.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2340 - Brian Slechta)

fixes for parallel asim-run (ie. forklocal).

the value of forklocal is the *max* number of child forks that can exist (plus
or minus a few). for example, if you set FORK_LOCAL=25 in your asimrc,
asim-run will allow up to 25 simultaneous benchmark setups at once. this will
speed up submissions to netbatch and especially virtual netbatch.

NOTE: forklocal is still beta. use caution. :)

NOTE: try with lower settings of forklocal and if your machine is ok, you can
increase it. you can easily swamp your machine if you set this too high.

apm-find-relace was updated with enhanced filtering capabilities
and the ability to rename models.

The semantics of find_module_{providing,requiring}() in Asim::Model
and Asim::Module have changed to not include searching of the
modules in a submodel. To get the previous behavior one much first
invoke emded_submodles on the model. The only script that actually
relied on the old semantics was hasim-connect, and it has been
updated.

did a *lot* of cleanup in asim-run. the major changes include the explicit
passing of variables to functions so that we can avoid all the problems of

that i am aware of. both local build and batch build modes seem to work great
now. <fingers_crossed> also, i fixed the "use of unitialized variables" in
PutEnv. the rest of the changes are just cleanup.

added WARN and WARNX to mesg.h. these macros are like ASSERT but they do not

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2367 - Carl Beckmann)

- Fixed the "branch package" command for SVN packages in asim-shell.
The semantics are a little different than the old CVS version of this command.
You used to have to commit all your changes before creating a branch,
and now you can create a branch even if you have uncommitted changes in
your working copy. Your working copy will be switched over to the new
branch, and your uncommitted changes will still be there.

Also, you can now create a branch from another branch.

Unlike the old CVS version, your admin/packages file will *not* be
renamed to the new branch name, nor will you get a new CSN series starting
at 1. This is because CSN numbers track the SVN revision numbers, which are
global across the trunk and all branches (unlike CVS where they were
hierarchical).

As a BKM for creating branches, I would like to suggest using all upper case,
with a short descriptive title and a date.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2388 - Brian Slechta)

augmented the DRAL/PTV API to support reference counting on event records.
this uses the existing ptlib reference counting feature. you can use
reference counting to allow multiple objects share the same PTV record. for
example, a cbox message can share the parent idi message's ptv record. here
is an example using the ASIM_ITEM_CLASS API in item.h.

IDI_MSG_CLASS::IDI_MSG_CLASS(...)
{
EVENT(OpenEventRec());
}

IDI_MSG_CLASS::~IDI_MSG_CLASS()
{
EVENT(CloseEventRec());
}

CBOX_MSG_CLASS::CBOX_MSG_CLASS(IDI_MSG_CLASS *idi_msg, ...)
{
// this is the prefered method of inheriting ptv events.
EVENT(RefEventRec(idi_msg));

// *** OR ***

// this is another way to slice it, though not preferred.
// users should not play with ids from the api.
UINT32 did = idi_msg->GetRecId();
EVENT(RefEventRec(did));

// *** OR ***

// alternatively, this is the hackish way of doing it
// this is not good. and you should not close the record
// in the destructor. this can cause lots of issues
// if the idi_msg dies before the cbox_msg
EVENT(SetRecId(idi_msg->GetRecId()));
}

CBOX_MSG_CLASS::CBOX_MSG_CLASS(IDI_MSG_CLASS *idi_msg, ...)
{
// must close when using RecEventRec(). do *not* use this
// if you just manually set the id via SetRecId().
EVENT(CloseEventRec());
}

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2395 - Carl Beckmann)

- Implemented a "update bundle" command in asim-shell, that honors
version tags containing either CSN numbers or SVN branch or tag
specifiers, to give you functionality akin to CVS "sticky tags".
For example, if you define a bundle that uses specific stable versions
of certain packages, you can "update bundle <bundle>/<tag>" and always
get exactly those versions (it will not clobber them with the latest
version). this is useful if you want to define a bundle where one or
two packages are at HEAD and will get updated, and the others are at
specific versions and will stay stable.

You can also use "update bundle" to switch to a branch (i.e. a bundle
containing one or more packages on a branch), or to switch from the branch
back to the trunk. "Update bundle" is smart enough to use the "svn switch"
command instead of "svn update" when changing between branches/tags or
the trunk of repository.

Also cleaned up a few minor code and documentation issues in the
perl modules.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2402 - Carl Beckmann)

- Added the ability in SVN packages and bundles to check out or update to
a specific version along a branch. This capability evidently already
existed for CVS packages, and the SVN implementation is compatible with it,
at least in spirit. The following syntax is now supported for tags in
asim-shell package commands, and in bundle specifications:

HEAD - the latest revision on the main trunk
<branchname> - the latest revision on the named branch
CSN-<package>-<number> - a specific revision on the main trunk
CSN-<branchname>-<number> - a specific revision on a branch
<number> - a specific revision on the main trunk
<branchname>:<number> - a specific revision on a branch

Note that unlike in CVS where CSN numbers started at 1 again with each branch,
in SVN the branch shares the same revision number space with the main trunk,
so the numbers keep incrementing, and the branch is simply distinguished
by <branchname>.

Changes made to accomodate integrated power macro calls in ports for
models using the power infrastructure. In port.h, the access type of
the private members in ReadPort, WritePort, ReadSkidPort,
WriteSkidPort etc. are changed to protected. This is so that the
PowerReadPort, PowerWritePort etc. classes in the asim-power package
derived from the classes in port.h have access to those members as
well.
null_power_model.h has been modified to include the null model for the
power ports.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2422 - Angshuman Parashar)

Added support for a new AWB directive %sources, which is
used to specify list(s) of source files for a module. The
directive takes two switches: '-t' specifies the type of
source file (e.g., CPP, VERILOG, VHDL, BSV, etc.), and
'-v' specifies the visibility of the list of files (PUBLIC
or PRIVATE).

Example usage:
    %sources -t CPP -v PRIVATE foo.cpp bar.cpp baz.cpp
    %sources -t CPP -v PUBLIC  foo.h bar.h

The directives %private and %public are now deprecated.
However, for backward compatibility with existing .awb
files and with tools such as apm-edit, these directives,
as well as the Module.pm interfaces public() and private()
continue to work, although they are inefficient since they
are implemented as wrappers around the %sources framework.
Module writers and tool writers are encouraged to use the
new directive/interfaces.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2429 - Carl Beckmann)

- Support for AWB-friendly generic .cfx files.
Now you can create generic .cfx scripts that get their benchmark name
from what follows .cfx in the directory path, but there is now an additional
Directory() command in GenCFG::Auto that generic .cfx scripts can use to
display a directory of benchmarks that gets displayed in AWB.
(Got this partially from the MT branch, with some additional changes).

Modified the multi-tlist.cfx script so it can be used with AWB. If you make
a copy of (or soft link to) multi-tlist.cfx, then in AWB it will find any
.tlist files in the directory hierarchy below it, and it will set up a
multicore benchmark run to run all the listed traces in parallel on the model.
It works with pure-Asim style multicore models.

Various fixes for properly supporting bitkeeper respositories.

Changes in Package::Copy, Repository::* are for proper elimination of

Package::DB changes are to skip over SCCS/ directories during
various package administration operations.

a more reasonable place.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2446 - Joel Emer)

Added (partial) support of submodel parameters.

The parameters in a module within a submodel can now be specified
as global with the --global switch on the %param directive. These
parameters will be visible at the submodel level and thus can be
set in the parent model that includes the submodel. Thus, in
apm-edit a submodel will display parameters that can be updated.

NOTE: this only works for HAsim models, since AMC and its C++
libraries do not yet support this functionality.

The changes in apm-edit were to use the method smart_add_module()
in Asim::Model to add new modules into a model. This functionality
includes the uniform reinsertion of the current child modules of a
module that is being replaced as the children of the new module
and the new capability to preserve the overrides on parameters in
the old module as the same named parameters in the new module.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2459 - Brian Slechta)

Ok, everything is still broken from the previous commits. We need to make
forward progress, and it is apparent that there are still issues. I have
reverted the following packages. The revisions now reflect the HEAD
of their respective repositories thus backing out Guru's changes.

I would suggest committing all these changes to svn branches and testing
before committing to the mainline. You can safely use "svn merge"
capabilities to bring everything back. If you have questions or concerns, let
me know.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2461 - Carl Beckmann)

- Speed amd usability improvements to asim-run provided by Ankush Varma.
Asim-run now looks in the following directories for pre-built models:
.
<name>
default/<name>
pm
<name>/pm
default/<name>/pm
BUILD
<name>/BUILD
default/<name>/BUILD
<model_name>
default/<model_name>
<model_name>/pm
default/<model_name>/pm
<model_name>/BUILD

where <name> and <model_name> are the APM file base name, and the model
name specified in the asim-run experiments file, respectively.

Also, improved the speed of checking netbatch queue status by only
looking at the queue being submitted to.

- Added an asim-shell command:

baseline packages

that can be used to get the version information for all
packages in the current workspace. Its output can be cut
and pasted into bundle files to easily specify a baseline
on a bundle.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2469 - Carl Beckmann)

- Added a switch to the "baseline packages" command, so we can either use
the CSN numbers from admin packages, or query SVN to get the latest revision
number information. These numbers can get out of sync with one another for
a variety of reason, including checkins on other branches, or because
people "cheat" and commit without using asim-shell. Checkouts and bundles
can safely use either form of output.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2554 - Joel Emer)

In asim-shell and awb:
Generalized many of the package commands to take 'all' or a list of
package names.


Just in asim-shell:
Added --source switch to 'install package' to install a public version
of a package. Underlying support for this was aded to Asim perl library.


In Asim perl library and apm-edit:
Use Asim::invoke_editor(), Asim::get_editor() and Asim::get_tmpdir()


In Asim.pm
Centralized the definitions and use of the EDITOR and TMPDIR environment
variables and added use of ASIMEDITOR and ASIMTMPDIR by adding the
following functions:

Asim::invoke_editor() - to invoke an editor on a file. Editor is
obtained from Asim::get_editor()

Asim::get_editor() - get the GUI-style editor command defined by
ASIMEDITOR or EDITOR

Asim::get_tmpdir() - to get the name of the temporary directory
defined by ASIMTMPDIR or TMPDIR.

 inifile.cpp               Locally Modified          239 

Enhanced the search for rcfile options to include the file
<workspace>awb.config. So now program's such as regression.*
and asim-run will look for their options first in awb.config,
then in ~/.asim/asimrc and then in <installdir>/etc/asim/asimrc.

All the scripts that use options have been enchanced with an
--options switch that lists the options that the program uses,
and their current values.

All of this means that one can set options on a per workspace
basis, so if, for example, one has a workspace for working on
hasim, then they can set up default regressions for that workspace
to regress the hasim packages by adding the following to their
awb.config file for that workspace.

awb.config:
.
.
.
[regression.launcher]
PACKAGES=hasim,hasim-mips
.
.
.

Finally, the change to inifile.cpp in libawb is to allow dot (.)
in a inifile group name, and must be installed system-wide before
the above funcionality will function correctly.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2569 - Brian Slechta)

fixed DRAL/PTV to work on x86-64 machines compiling in 64-bit. actually, this
library still has non-portable var-args code. there is no portable way to
create a va_list and we currently need that to interface with the ptv
library. once we are able to modify the ptv library api to accept lists
instead of var-args, we can eliminate this portability issue.

since gcc has changed the way var-args work with x86-64, we need to compile
with slightly different code. to enable ptv, use the following in your
awb.config.

For 32-bit (IA-32 and x86-64 machines):

[Package]
CONFIGFLAGS=--enable-64bit=0 --enable-ptv=yes

For 64-bit:

[Package]
CONFIGFLAGS=--enable-64bit=1 --enable-ptv=new

make sure you re-build appropriate libraries using:

asim-shell clean package <packagename>
asim-shell build package <packagename>

Refactored the batch code in asim-run so that the batch subsystem code
is in separate perl modules. The idea is that there are separate
modules for supporting netbatch, netbatch-remote, local and eventually
other batch subsystems. Each module needs to support the batch
operations that we supported directly in asim-rum in a batch system
specific way, e.g., check size of a directory, check number of
threads, schedule to reduce number of jobs in-flight, and submit the
job. The data sloshing for the remote runs is still done manually in
asim-run and asim-batch.

In asim-shell, have 'update package' build using the common
configure_and_build_packages subroutine. This routine
includes properly ordering builds by package priority.

In Fork.pm, open child's STDOUT/STDERR logfile in a way
that preserves the redirection in subprocesses of the child.
Also, added a convenience predicate argument in the
controlled_fork and controlled_exit routines.

In asim-run, use the new interface to controlled_fork and
controlled_exit and properly reset the $exit_code value
on entry to a child, so that a pending error code in the
parent isn't propagated to all the children.

In Inifile.pm, fix a minor bug in the perldoc directives.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2583 - Michael Adler)

Add a Benchmarks Perl library to define ISA-independent properties of
workloads. The CPU2000_data module defines all CPU2000 arguments,
inputs, outputs and specdiff commands to check the output.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2585 - Joel Emer)

Some random minor enhancements to asim-shell:

Improved the behavior of commands to build/run models by
separating model and benchmark commands and having the
commands remember the current model and benchmark so that
one needn't specify them repeatedly. So to configure, build
and run a model on a benchmark one can do the following:

asim-shell> configure model <model apm file>
asim-shell> build model
asim-shell> setup benchmark <benchmark .cfg file>
asim-shell> run benchmark


Added some regression related commands:

asim-shell> list regressions
asim-shell> delete regression


Finally package build options CONFIGFLAGS and MAKEFLAGS are now
obtained using the standard options search path, i.e., first
look in awb.config, then ~/.asim/asimrc and finally in
<installdir>/etc/asim/asimrc.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2593 - Sailashri Parthasarathy)

Fixing a bug in the Random clock server.The clockserver was clocking all the modules and rate matchers associated with a time event before moving on to the next time event (also scheduled for this cycle). Changing its behavior to clock all the modules of all the time events scheduled for this cycle before clocking the rate matcher ports. This is now similar to the behavior of the regular clock server.

Adding a null model (null_model.apm) that contains a null core and a null feeder. The original feeder interface has been retained. Adding the following null modules to the model:
1. Null cpu
2. Null core
3. Null hardware context
4. Null software context
5. Null context scheduler
6. Null micro inst class
7. Null macro inst class
8. Null isa
9. Null instruction address class
10. Null feeder implementation
11. Null cpu mode
12. Null warmup manager (provided by Carl)

For some modules, all the public functions have been retained and they return null. For some other modules, only relevant functions (such as constructor/destructor) have been retained while the remaining ones have been removed.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2628 - Steve Raasch)

* Minor update to asim-run adds the "--nbtask <netbatch-taskname>"
option. Using this option adds <netbatch-taskname> to the NB queuing
command and makes it available to other NB tools as a job identifier.

* Add run-with-params.cfx
This CFX allows you to specify an arbitrary number of traces plus
options for the model, the feeder, and the system portions of the
command-line.

* Add tlist2bm.pl
This script takes a Portland-style tracelist, and converts it to an
ASIM-style benchmark file using 'run-with-params.cfx'. This allows us
to run traces with the same parameters as other groups (including
simulation length, skipping, and start-point).

- added ability to specify a directory in the BUILD directory to hold
files that are read in at run time.  This is needed for remote
netbatch environments.  With this feature, these run time files
will be copied to the remote netbatch location by asim-run.  The directory
can be specified in asimrc with RUN_TIME_DIR= or on the command line with
--run_time_dir.  Right now this ONLY allows directories that are in the
BUILD directory.

- there's also a change to not rsync anything to a remote netbatch
location if the --nobuild option is specified.

 asim-shell                Locally Modified          277 

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2655 - Carl Beckmann)

- Added an object class to query build tree configuration information
  from autoconf configure script output.

- Added an asim-shell command "show configuration <packages...>" to print
  build tree configuration information

- Added an asim-shell command "verify configuration <packages...>" to
  verify compatibility of the build tree configurations for the listed
  packages.  The most common usage is "verify configuration all" check checks
  all packages for consistency.
  
  The check is normally done using only a small amount of information from
  configure, i.e. the machine type and OS release version, the C++ compiler
  and version, and the ARCHFLAGS setting.  But a more exhaustive check can
  be done using the --exhaustive switch to this asim-shell command (although
  this usually results in spurious mismatches).

- Added some automated checks of package build tree configurations that get
  invoked in asim-shell upon:
  + startup
  + checkout or update of packages
  + manually configuring packages
  + adding public or other packages
  The checks are disabled in batch mode.  They can also be explicitly
  disabled using a new command line switch --noconfigcheck

  This check should catch the most common configuration mismatches, e.g.
  checking out different packages on different host architectures, or
  inconsistent 32/64-bit build settings.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2707 - Carl Beckmann)

- Added a "new bundle" command to asim-shell.  See online help.

  Here are some typical example usage models:

  To create a bundle consisting of the HEAD version of all packages
  in the current workspace, named "mybundle" do:

    asim> new bundle mybundle --head

  To create a bundle named "mybundle/2008_01_26" consisting of the
  packages "axp", "simcore" and "x86" only, do:

    asim> new bundle mybundle/2009_01_26 --packages=axp,simcore,x86

  To create a bundle consisting of the current versions of those
  packages needed to build the model "config/pm/my/broken/model.apm":

    asim> set model config/pm/my/broken/model.apm
    asim> new bundle mybundle/BAD_JAN_26_09 --model=.

  To create a bundle consisting of the current versions of all those
  packages needed to build all the models used in the asim-run file
  in experiments/axp/my_axp_exps/my_axp_exps.model, do:

    asim> new bundle mybundle/MY_AXP_EXPS --experiment=axp/my_axp_exps

  If you goof and want to redo a previous bundle, just redo the command
  and it will prompt you whether to overwrite the bundle information.

  Normally it stores bundle information under $HOME/.asim/bundles, but
  if you have privileges (e.g. asim1) you can use --install to write into
  <install>/etc/asim/bundles (where <install> is probably something like
  /p/asim/x86_64_linux26/).  You can also use the --file option to redirect
  bundle information to an arbitrary file (for example if you want to send
  the bundle information to someone else, to reproduce an error elsewhere).

Updating with awb changes (rev. 2780 - Carl Beckmann)

- A number of small changes to make it easier to configure netbatch operation
  in Portland correctly:

  + re-enabled the asim-run configuration variables ENABLE_NETBATCH_PRE and
    NETBATCH_PRE_USE_SMARTCLASS so we can independently disable the use of a pre-exec script or the smart class specifiers to check for minimum disk space requirements (some netbatch queues apparently do not support the disk space check smart class), and also setting the minimum disk space (MIN_TMP_SPACE_MB) to zero disables the check.

  + multiple "-C" class specifiers to netbatch are now consolidated into a single "-C" boolean AND expression, since netbatch seems to either ignore all but the last -C or assumes a boolean OR.

  + added some missing code modules to the "help code" command, and fixed a few minor documentation items.

  + updated the asimrc template with some missing parameter descriptions

- Various enhancements to apm-edit:
     - Modules have a 'notes' operation to view the 'notes' about a module
     - Module edit operation now opens all source files (including make/scons files)
     - Model operations to 'setup' and 'run' the 'default benchmark' were added
     - Added various keyboard accelerators, .e.g.,
                ^E - edit current module
                ^I - open notes for current module
                F9 - configure model
                F10 - build model
                F11 - setup benchmark
                F12 - run benchmark

     - Miscelaneous changes
            - Added ./fix-ui and patch file to fix incompatible changes generated by designer 3.3
            - Fixed apm-edit::runlog to avoid hangs on exit (basically copied awb::runlog)

- Supporting changes in Asim::Model:
      - Model's now have a DefaultBenchmark
      
- Supporting changes in Asim::Module:
      - Added the concept of 'notes' to a module.
      - Made scons() method uniform with other source file methods by accepting and returning a list
           (hasim-configure only deals with lists of length one)

Enhancement to apm-edit suggested by Elliot:

any of children) have non-default values, then the user is
queried whether they want to change ALL the parameters for the
module (and its children) to their default value.

 apm_edit.ui.h             Locally Modified          321 

Added implementation of the notion of a 'template' module, which 
can be used to hold a skeleton implementation for modules of the
given awb-type and hold notes relevant to all modules of that awb-type.

A template module is indicated by a --template flag on the %provides 
directive in an .awb file

Template modules show up as alternatives in apm-edit, but cannot be inserted
into the model.

Also put in a fix for the periodic crash experienced by apm-edit from 
what appears to be a perlqt bug on certain ListView method calls. Fix was
to put an eval{} expression around the suspect method calls.

For 'global' awb parameters defined in a module within a submodel that
itself is included in an outer submodel, we now allow changing such
parameters at the level of the model that includes the outer submodel.
In other words, 'global' awb parameters are always visible regardless of
whether they are buried in multiple levels of submodels.

Added a -completioncmd flag to asim-run.  This flag will run a
specified command at the end of a regression run.  In the case of
condor, this will cause a DAG of jobs to be specified.  For local
runs, the command will run serially at the end of the last job in the
regression.  I made no attempt at porting to Netbatch.  I use the
feature for nightly regressions, when I want plot.nightly to run at
the end of my regression, rather than guessing when I should run this

 Module.pm                 Locally Modified          369 

Added support for python libraries in SCons.  %scons %library will create a symlink in the new site_scons directory.  This enables, among other things, a relatively easy way to break down the monolithic makefile.  It also sets the stage for Altera support.  The edit is a little rough, and I would like to investigate using a more SConsy object-oriented approach with the Builder and Node classes.

Initial support for building debian packages for awb.

To directly build the source and then the binary package
type the following:

     % cd <root-of-awb-package>
     % debuild -rsudo -S
     % debuild -rsudo

Some things that still need to be done are complete 
dependency specifications and proper placement of 
configuration files into /etc. I'm sure that's not all.

Building with pbuilder has not been tested.

More .deb support. 

When installing using a .deb file, the conffiles, i.e., the
files in etc/asim, are now put into /etc/asim instead of
PREFIX/etc/asim. Both asimstarter and Asim.pm now check in
/etc/asim first before using the default, PREFIX/etc/asim.

Note: if we eventually make our nomenclature consistent and
use 'awb' instead of 'asim' those files will need to change. Or
maybe configure.in should handle this...

The name of the system-wide asimrc file in the repository
was changed from asimrc.template to asimrc to make things
easier for the .deb install procedure. It is still just called
asimrc in etc/.

Moved the simple template workspace from etc/asim/ws to 
share/asim/ws, since it is not really a configuration file
and it was complicating the debinan installs. That change
reguired changes in configure.in, and various Makefiles, so
autoconf made lots of gratuituous changes.

Improvements to debian build mechanism.

Added distribution name to version and moved to 'main'. 
Also added some dependencies to control.

Builds seem to work for karmic and lucid, although there 
are still lots of complaints from lintian.

Added a make target of install-package, which installs
the module pool (and base/) in $codedir, which is 
currently PREFIX/share/asim/<package>/<version>. The
debian install does that install so that one can
have the awb module pool even without checking out
the package.

Make a few other improvements for .deb creation.

Added symlink from awb to awb2 in libexec, so awb launches 
properly when using the centrally installed version.

Fixed perl version check in asimstarter.

Added cvs to list of required packages for the .deb package

Moved check for the environment variable CSH_RSH into the 
usage of CVS to avoid the annoying messages about it when 
one isn't using CVS.

Did an autoreconf to upgrade to a new version of autotools.

Added the Leap (Logic-based Environment for Application
Programming) .pack file, which defines the new Leap 
repository and the associated Leap platform repository.
The HAsim .pack file now defines only modeling-related 
repositories.

Added support for a awb model type of 'Leap', which use
a set of leap-* commands, such as leap-configure, in 
place of the misnamed hasim-* commands.

Updated asimstarter to understand the leap-* commands,
which means that a new install of awb will be required
before one can use the commands from the (soon to be 
populated) Leap package.

Note that .apm files with model type 'HAsim' will currently
continue to use the hasim-* commands in the HAsim package. 
Eventually, however, a checkout of the Leap package will
be required to build.

 asimrc                    Locally Modified          387 

A variety of improvements to documentation and to distinguish 
awb from asim.

Changed name of various asim-<name> programs to be called 
awb-<name>.  Maintaining backwards compatibility via symbolic 
links and having the programs look for rc options first in group 
[awb-<name>] and then in [asim-<name>]. After all your workspaces 
are updated to this version of the awb pacakge you should change 
the asim- groups to be awb- in ~/.asim/asimrc.

Added creation of man files from the perl documentation for
a number of programs. In the process, fixed a number of perlpod 
syntax errors.

Converted perl builds to type 'vendor', which puts files (in
particular man page) where we want them, and doesn't generate 
the superflous podlocal files, which now don't need to be deleted 
during install. In the process, fixed a bunch of perl MANIFEST 
files.

Bug fix on locating <INSTALLDIR>/etc/asim/asimrc, when awb is 
installed using the .deb file.

edit.  I don't think that this fix is complete, and I certainly
haven't tried to test beyond some basic use cases.  However, strings
are now editable from the gui,to the point that apms with strings can
be configured and buit.

Added support for creating a new repository for a package.
Currently only svn repositories are supported. 

The procedure for creating a new repository is:

1) Create an empty repository on your sever

2) Run the following commands

   % awb-shell create package <pkgname>
   ...answer questions...
   % awb-shell create repository <pkgname>
   ...answer questions...
   % awb-shell checkout package <pkgname>
   ...answer questions...

A .pack file is also created, which can be
installed globally, e.g., by adding it to
the awb package.  This .pack file is placed in:

   ~/.asim/repositories.d/<pkgname>.pack

* Integration of changes from Intel revisions 2847-2981.

CSN: CSN-awb-2851
          

- fixed a bug in the Package label() method when moving an existing tag.
  The previous revision of the tag must be removed first.

CSN: CSN-awb-2876
          

- a simple fix to batch script to help monitor the run progress.  Thanks to
  Joel for the fix.


CSN: CSN-awb-2877
          

- a possible fix to RUN/ areas incorrectly ending up with both .SUBMITTED
  and .RUNNING file.  Before we generate a RUNNING file, spin-wait a few
  seconds for SUBMITTED file to appear.  Similar to remote rsync
  implementation.

CSN: CSN-awb-2916
          

- implemented "merge package" command for SVN
- added "revert package" command


CSN: CSN-awb-2926
          

- fixed a bug in "new bundle" command, that was causing an error if the
  destination directory for the bundle file does not exist yet.

CSN: CSN-awb-2955
          

- fixed a bug in the recognition of integer parameters.
  Now hex values of the form "0x..." and integers suffixed with
  "L", "U", "ULL" etc. are recognized as integers by the Module class.


CSN: CSN-awb-2956
          

- bug fix to numeric parameter parsing in Module class


CSN: CSN-awb-2957
          

- fixed a few more bugs in parameter parsing:
  + parameters with empty description strings
  + numeric parameters with negative default values
  
CSN: CSN-awb-2978
          

- fixed an apparent typo in asim-batch

* Add .apm file format 2.2. This format is backwards-compatible with v2.1, so 
  old versions of AWB will be able to read the new files.
  
* In the new version, the Name and Provides of submodel roots is stored in the 
  Globals section of the file. This facilitates finding the new location of the
  file if it has moved on disk. 
  
* This will also facilitate moving LEAP models to have root type "project." So
  far nothing has changed on this front yet.
  
* Fix get_module() to not go infinite when the root module of a submodel has 
  moved.

* Add new line to APM Properties to allow user to set top-level provides.

* The default provides is "model" for Asim and HAsim and "project" for Leap.

* If the user writes something else then the default will not be applied.

* Improve detection of "stale" information in a .apm file, which means that the
  .apm file contains information taken from .awb files which have subsequently
  been updated. This subsumes the previous detection of files moving on disk
  and currently includes:
  
  * %name has changed
  * %requires have been added or removed
  * File location has changed in UnionDir
  * Package has changed

* Additionally staleness/brokeness of submodels has now been distinguished from
  that of main models. The user should no longer receive messages that say 
  "possibly in a submodel" but instead will be asked if they want to open the
  problem submodel(s) directly.
  
* Additionally, a checkbox is added to the GUI that allows highlighting of 
  models with problems. Stale models are shown in orange, broken models in red.
  The checkbox is off by default since scanning them models is currently a bit
  slow. (We have some future performance improvements in mind.)

* To highlight slow operations awb and apm-edit can now change the cursor to
  the standard "hourglass" to show intense background work. Currently this is
  only enabled for the most obvious intense tasks (scanning modules, rehashing
  databases). It would be easy to use this in more places if it proves useful.
  
* Makefiles updated because of addition of a file for color highlighting.

Michael P.

Split package into multiple .deb files:

     awb           - a dependency package for awb-<version>
     awb-<version> - the shared package files
     awb-bin       - the executable/library/conf files


Now one can install the latest version of the package 
and binaries, e.g.,

     # apt-get install awb 

but one can explictly install multiple versions of the 
shared package subset of the files, e.g,

     # apt-get install awb-0.6

The files still are put into directories named HEAD. That
still needs to be fixed.

Added specific support for using 'public' installed copies of
packages as well as a 'copy' of a package.

Convert awb-shell 'use package' command to 'use' a publically
installed package by adding it into your searchpath. Such packages
live at $PREFIX/share/asim/packages/<PACKAGE>/<VERSION>. An optional
switch (--copy) will copy the package into your workspace. Optional
deletion is provided for existing references to the package in your
SEARCHPATH and of exisiting copies of the package in your workspace.

Added notion of a 'stable' version of a package as indicated by the
'STABLE' tag for, e.g., awb/STABLE, which refers to the latest 
released version of a package. A released version of package is
indicated by a stylized tag of the form v[0-9]+[._][0-9]+, e.g., 
v10.03.

Added an 'upgrade package' command to awb-shell that will upgrade a
package (or all packages) to the latest stable release.

All of this is in prepartion for a test release of the awb package,
along with a mechanism for allowing a using of a release to easily
upgrade to the release.

     - fixed a problem in awb-run's --rerun option, wherein models were getting
       rebuilt which were still running.  Now, the model configure and build 
       steps are skipped if there are any .RUNNING or .SUBMITTED files for

   Clean up the code that checks for regressions already running:
     - Start regressions immediately if not connected to STDIN (e.g. running in

     - Start regressions after 10 seconds if no response received.  The old code
       tried to do this but failed.

Refined support for installation of multiple releases. In specific,

1) Globally installed packages now placed in:

    $PREFIX/share/asim/packages/<package>/<version>

2) Applications always install at same place until we need multiple
   copies of applications:

   $PREFIX/libexec/asim/<package>/HEAD

3) New workspaces no longer get asimcore by default because we
   don't necessarily want to use head and can't be sure what
   the current version is. Maybe eventually we can get the /STABLE
   version but for now one should do an explict 'use', e.g.,
 
   % awb-shell use asimcore/HEAD

   or

   % awb-shell use asimcore/v11.04 (if installed)

Add repository information for release v11.04 of awb,
asim-core, leap and platforms packages.

Make debian package depend on both the current and the
previous release of package. Thus, an upgrade will not
automatically wipe out previous version of the package 
in /usr/share/asim/awb/. It would be better if a new
install just left previous versions alone, but I couldn't
get that to work.

Added three commands to asim-shell with the intention of making
command line apm manipulation a bit simpler. I only added those
commands which appear to be necessary for multifpga at this time.
Others may be needed later, including a function to manipulate
parameters.

cp - copies a file with respect to the union dir hierarchy 

create submodel - give a model, awb type, and a path, creates a submodel from
the hierarchy rooted at awb type in the given model

replace module - given a model and a submodel, inserts the submodel
into the model hierarchy

This is useful in communicating setting during the multifpga build.
An option would be to use shell variables, but this seems less robust.

Added support for 'obsolete' modules (and submodels).  In specific,

1) A module with the %attribute 'obsolete' will be treated as obsolete,
   as will a model that has that attribute or contains a module (or
   submodel) with that attribute.

2) On opening a model in apm-edit, a popup will announce that obsolete
   models contain something obsolete and offer to open obsolete
   submodels.

3) Once a model is opened in apm-edit, obsolete modules will be flagged
   with an 'o' in the tree view and a warning will appear in the information
   pane for the module.

4) An attempt to insert an obsolete module (or submodel) will be challenged
   with a query as to whether the user really wants to insert an obsolete
   module.

Some bug fixes:

1) On opening a model some gratuitous re-opens of the model following
   the 'health check' were eliminated.

2) A file named README is now a legal %notes file (along with any file
   named *.txt.


Added utility functions:

1) Added a module level method to recursively traverse a module tree
   looking for modules with a specified attribute.

 Model.pm                  Locally Modified          476 

Improved behavior of parameters of submodels. New behavior is
related to the default value of a submodel parameter as seen by
the parent model, i.e., the value of 'global' parameter in the 
submodel. Previously, that value was taken only from the module's 
.awb file. Now that default value may be taken from an override of 
the parameter value in the submodel. This saves a lot of writing 
of parameter values in the parent model's .apm file, and allows 
the value of a submodel parameter to be changed in all model's 
that use the submodel simply by changing the value in the submodel.

Log message:	CSN: CSN-awb-3051


- Added an option to awb-run that lets you run simulations on an explicit
list of hosts via ssh, rather than using Netbatch or Condor. To use it,
use the command line argument --hostlist or the asimrc parameter
USE_HOST_LIST and set the -pool command line argument or POOL asimrc param
to a comma-separated list of hostnames. Jobs will be run via ssh.
- also fixed a few lines in the multithreading core reseration for netbatch
that had somehow gotten deleted from a previous commit.

- "awb-shell baseline packages" now works for git repositories. It returns
the md5hash corresponding to the HEAD version in the local repository.
The command used to retrieve the hash is "git rev-parse HEAD". 
- Branch/tag/Md5hash can be added to the clone/checkout commands for git
repositories
Example: "awb-shell clone package testgit/testbranch"
or "awb-shell clone package testgit/e8b9f07fb13b20c7b7b4b606a54f3fecbdceccb8"
The hash tag is ugly but it uniquely identifies the snapshot of the 
repository across all references (branches/tags). 
- Specifying only the first few characters in the hash should be
sufficient in most cases.

Fix to the Git wrapper in Awb. Following is the expected behavior now. 
If a specific revision of keiko is cloned/checked out using a commit tag 
$awb-shell clone package keiko/<commit-tag>
It will be checked out as a local asim-release branch. (this is imposed by the way git checks out a particular revision)

On that package if a pull/update is done then an error is thrown
awb-shell pull package keiko OR awb-shell update package keiko 
Package: Error - Branch asim-release does not exist in the remote repository.
You probably checked out a specific commit tag
Consider checking out master branch and then pull
awb-shell checkout package <name>/master
awb-shell pull package name
If you have local changes then consider merging with master

Also if a pull/update of master is done while asim-release is checked
out 
$awb-shell pull package keiko/master
Then just like native git, changes from remote master will be merged
into the asim-release branch. But asim-release will still be checked
out.

Fixed display of alternatives when doing command completion
on a uniondir-based file.

Backport of changes in CSN-awb-502 by emer
          
Tab completion in awb-shell now works for .cfx files.

The awb-shell 'source' command now looks to see if
the input file is executable and if it is invokes
that file (passing in the additional arguments on the
command line) and executes the series of commands 
printed to STDOUT by that executable. Note the arguments
are not treated specially so fancy quoting or substitutions
will probably not work.
