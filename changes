Improve performance of awb on CFX files:
- Add --listflags option fo all CFX files. This lets awb find out whether
a generated CFG file has multiple regions in a single pass instead of
having to invoke the CFX file twice.
- Cache the result of CFX queries for 1 minute in awb. The awb GUI
is constantly probing the CFX file, even with mouse events. The cache
greatly improves performance.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2243)

- For well over a year, the port code has been dynamically allocating
the storage associated with each read port. Since it's now doing it
dynamically (it used to be statically allocated), 2 assertions that
were checking the static size were irrelevant and removed.

Furthermore, there was no longer any need to specify a static size
in any port declaration if the port's bandwidth or latency exceeded
the default static size. So, all of these template parameters were
removed to make the code easier to read and understand.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2254)

- Added the ability to specify command line args in a file,
using the syntax

-cfg <filename>

This arguments file can have one or multiple arguments on a line, or 
comments starting with hash (#),and config files can recursively call
 other config files.

This option should work in --feeder, --system or awb args sections,
or you could have a single file containing both --feeder and --system
sections.

Argument values may contain double-quoted (") sections, and the quote
characters are stripped before further parsing by the simulator, as they
would be in the shell. Thus any arg lists currently in .models files can
be copied verabatim into config files for use with -cfg.

This change was made to the classic controller base class, so any controller
based on it will inherit this feature.

- Fixed the perl Qt search path to look under .../lib64/... on SUSE64 with perl 5.8.7
instead of lib32, since that version of perl seems to be a true 64-bit binary.
- Added a make target "install-src-public" that does the same as "install-sc" but also
makes the installed source tree world-readable.

- look for PerlQt in either .../lib32/... or .../lib64/... depending
on whether you are on x86_64 or not, on SUSE.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2263)

- several additions to the asim build area:
1. added an option to specify the build location. In conjunction with
nobuild option, this can be used to pickup models from an alternate
location. 
2. delineated build and run directories. Resdir can reside in a 
seperate space from the build directory.
3. changed the default model build location of amc to asim-root/build/default.
4. changed default result directory for asim-run from '.' to asim-root/build/default.
5. removed altexepath. Buildarea option is meaningful in both build and nobuild option.

- Remove LAZY_DEST template option from ASIM_MM_CLASS. It was never used
and will get in the way of optimizing the class for multithreading.
- Update the cross-process port methods. For now they use spin locks.
We'll need to add exponential backoff.
- Disable events for multithreaded models. Obviously this will have to
be fixed.
- Fix mismatched malloc/free in args.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2268)

Fix a problem that lead to recursive clearing of the same reference.
When the ref count reached 0 for a pointer being cleared the destructor
was being called before the pointer was cleared. This can lead to
recursive attempts to clear the pointer if the destructor checks the
pointer and tries to clear it. (E.g. Removing an object from a list.)
Changed the code to decrement the ref count, clear the pointer and then
call the destructor if the ref count is 0.

- Added a function "ShiftPath()" to Asim::GenCFG::Auto, to make it easy to
extract parameters passed as part of the virtual path using cfx scripts,
for example:

my/script.cfx/param1/param2/the/rest/of/the/path.cfg

In the cfx script you can now easily extract these parameters:

$param1 = Asim::GenCFG::Auto::ShiftPath();
$param2 = Asim::GenCFG::Auto::ShiftPath();

Leaving "the/rest/of/the/path" to be substituted as @BENCHMARKPATH@.
See "asim-shell help code" on GenCFG::Auto for details.

Updated "single-check-param.cfx" to use this new feature.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2302)

This commit adds support for removing a reference to a
package from the awb search path specified in the awb.config file
(so long as the reference to the package does not result from a
crossproduct {a,b,c} expansion in the search path). This support is
used as part of checkout to ask a user if they want to remove
a reference to a particular package if they are checking out
a package with the same name. This should result in the elimination
of the annoying message about multiple copies of a package after
one checks out simcore and the reference to the public version was 
left in the search path.

Specific changes involved a refactoring of the workspace
search path manipultation code, a new accessor in the repository object
to find the name of the package the repository holds, and some bug
fixes when a workspace contaings no packages.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2292-2294: Joel Emer)

The commit adds support for finding repository .pack files from a
list of places rather than an single file asim.pack. This packfile
path can contain either individual .pack files or directories, in
which case all of the files (matching the pattern *.pack) will be
used. 

The default packfile path is 
$HOME/.asim/repositories.d
$HOME/.asim/asim.pack
<install-dir>/etc/asim/repositories.d
<install-dir>/etc/asim/asim.pack

That list can be overridden in asim-shell on the command line with
the --repositoryDB switch.

A later phase of this process will involve populating the repositories.d
directory.

Joel

Fixed Makefile bug.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2304 - Carl Beckmann)

- The input file argument to stat-to-text can now be omitted
to use STDIN instead, in order to use this as a filter
(e.g. "zcat foo.stats.gz | stat-to-text")
