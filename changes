Improve performance of awb on CFX files:
- Add --listflags option fo all CFX files. This lets awb find out whether
a generated CFG file has multiple regions in a single pass instead of
having to invoke the CFX file twice.
- Cache the result of CFX queries for 1 minute in awb. The awb GUI
is constantly probing the CFX file, even with mouse events. The cache
greatly improves performance.

 port.cpp                  Locally Modified           27 

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2243)

- For well over a year, the port code has been dynamically allocating
the storage associated with each read port. Since it's now doing it
dynamically (it used to be statically allocated), 2 assertions that
were checking the static size were irrelevant and removed.

Furthermore, there was no longer any need to specify a static size
in any port declaration if the port's bandwidth or latency exceeded
the default static size. So, all of these template parameters were
removed to make the code easier to read and understand.
