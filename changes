Improve performance of awb on CFX files:
- Add --listflags option fo all CFX files. This lets awb find out whether
a generated CFG file has multiple regions in a single pass instead of
having to invoke the CFX file twice.
- Cache the result of CFX queries for 1 minute in awb. The awb GUI
is constantly probing the CFX file, even with mouse events. The cache
greatly improves performance.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2243)

- For well over a year, the port code has been dynamically allocating
the storage associated with each read port. Since it's now doing it
dynamically (it used to be statically allocated), 2 assertions that
were checking the static size were irrelevant and removed.

Furthermore, there was no longer any need to specify a static size
in any port declaration if the port's bandwidth or latency exceeded
the default static size. So, all of these template parameters were
removed to make the code easier to read and understand.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2254)

- Added the ability to specify command line args in a file,
using the syntax

-cfg <filename>

This arguments file can have one or multiple arguments on a line, or 
comments starting with hash (#),and config files can recursively call
 other config files.

This option should work in --feeder, --system or awb args sections,
or you could have a single file containing both --feeder and --system
sections.

Argument values may contain double-quoted (") sections, and the quote
characters are stripped before further parsing by the simulator, as they
would be in the shell. Thus any arg lists currently in .models files can
be copied verabatim into config files for use with -cfg.

This change was made to the classic controller base class, so any controller
based on it will inherit this feature.

- Fixed the perl Qt search path to look under .../lib64/... on SUSE64 with perl 5.8.7
instead of lib32, since that version of perl seems to be a true 64-bit binary.
- Added a make target "install-src-public" that does the same as "install-sc" but also
makes the installed source tree world-readable.

- look for PerlQt in either .../lib32/... or .../lib64/... depending
on whether you are on x86_64 or not, on SUSE.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2263)

- several additions to the asim build area:
1. added an option to specify the build location. In conjunction with
nobuild option, this can be used to pickup models from an alternate
location. 
2. delineated build and run directories. Resdir can reside in a 
seperate space from the build directory.
3. changed the default model build location of amc to asim-root/build/default.
4. changed default result directory for asim-run from '.' to asim-root/build/default.
5. removed altexepath. Buildarea option is meaningful in both build and nobuild option.

- Remove LAZY_DEST template option from ASIM_MM_CLASS. It was never used
and will get in the way of optimizing the class for multithreading.
- Update the cross-process port methods. For now they use spin locks.
We'll need to add exponential backoff.
- Disable events for multithreaded models. Obviously this will have to
be fixed.
- Fix mismatched malloc/free in args.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2268)

Fix a problem that lead to recursive clearing of the same reference.
When the ref count reached 0 for a pointer being cleared the destructor
was being called before the pointer was cleared. This can lead to
recursive attempts to clear the pointer if the destructor checks the
pointer and tries to clear it. (E.g. Removing an object from a list.)
Changed the code to decrement the ref count, clear the pointer and then
call the destructor if the ref count is 0.

- Added a function "ShiftPath()" to Asim::GenCFG::Auto, to make it easy to
extract parameters passed as part of the virtual path using cfx scripts,
for example:

my/script.cfx/param1/param2/the/rest/of/the/path.cfg

In the cfx script you can now easily extract these parameters:

$param1 = Asim::GenCFG::Auto::ShiftPath();
$param2 = Asim::GenCFG::Auto::ShiftPath();

Leaving "the/rest/of/the/path" to be substituted as @BENCHMARKPATH@.
See "asim-shell help code" on GenCFG::Auto for details.

Updated "single-check-param.cfx" to use this new feature.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2302)

This commit adds support for removing a reference to a
package from the awb search path specified in the awb.config file
(so long as the reference to the package does not result from a
crossproduct {a,b,c} expansion in the search path). This support is
used as part of checkout to ask a user if they want to remove
a reference to a particular package if they are checking out
a package with the same name. This should result in the elimination
of the annoying message about multiple copies of a package after
one checks out simcore and the reference to the public version was 
left in the search path.

Specific changes involved a refactoring of the workspace
search path manipultation code, a new accessor in the repository object
to find the name of the package the repository holds, and some bug
fixes when a workspace contaings no packages.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2292-2294: Joel Emer)

The commit adds support for finding repository .pack files from a
list of places rather than an single file asim.pack. This packfile
path can contain either individual .pack files or directories, in
which case all of the files (matching the pattern *.pack) will be
used. 

The default packfile path is 
$HOME/.asim/repositories.d
$HOME/.asim/asim.pack
<install-dir>/etc/asim/repositories.d
<install-dir>/etc/asim/asim.pack

That list can be overridden in asim-shell on the command line with
the --repositoryDB switch.

A later phase of this process will involve populating the repositories.d
directory.

Joel

Fixed Makefile bug.

added ptv support to dral. this can be enabled with --enable-ptv=yes. this
is off by default.

wrote and debugged new dral/ptv api for ptv-style event instrumentation. you
can now generate ptv logs using coho-bk or x86libs versions of ptlib.

added libnullptlib to be linked in with a ptv-enabled libdral when you do not
want to link in a real ptv library.

fix for asim bug #0000741.

created new "system" modules which have support for the new "dral_api" modules
(ie. version 2). added new "dral_api" modules.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2318 - Brian Slechta)

there is no ANSI compliant way to create var-args on the fly, so I created a
non-portable way to do this. this non-portability broke the SUSE64 build for
libdral. If you compile 32-bit binaries on 64-bit machines, this problem does
not come up.

i disabled all va_list code when --enable-ptv=no. the new dral/ptv api will
not do anything when this flag is enabled until this issue is actually
resolved.

this commit should fix the build on SUSE64 with 64-bit builds.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2323 - Joel Emer)

Added more uniform support for submodels. So in the base
library there is now support for a database of submodels,
i.e., .apm files whose root is not of asim-type "model".
A cache of this database is kept in <AWBLOCAL>/var, like
the module database, so a rehash of that cache is done
with the asim-shell command "rehash models" as well as
will a simple "rehash".

And in apm-edit, the box in the lower left showing
alternative modules lists submodels as alternatives, and
the "refresh" button (the terminology shouldn't be
different) will rehash the submodel cache.

added support for virtual netbatch. the flow has been tested in MMDC using
regular netbatch. the benchmarks are setup in the local workspace. run areas
and executables are rsync'd to the remote area, the runs are sent to netbach
to run in the remote area, and funally the results are then rsync'd back to the
workspace.

i will now test in AN using virtual netbatch options.

Updating with simcore changes rev. 2337 (Brian Slechta)

made changes to asim-run to support a faster local build. namely, i added the
ability to fork each build/setup to its own process to achieve greater
parallelism. make sure you can handle that many builds at once (eg. use
distcc). second, added timestamps and pids to output and logs. third, added
ability to control the distcc "-j" level. this is most useful when you are
parallelizing many builds.

WARNING: this forking is still relatively experimental

new options are (params and asimr variables):

--printtimes!, PRINT_TIMES, defaults to 1
--forklocal!, FORK_LOCAL, defaults to 0
--distccjlevel, DISTCC_JLEVEL, defaults to ""

added header to all three scripts for perl syntax highlighting in emacs.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2340 - Brian Slechta)

fixes for parallel asim-run (ie. forklocal).

the value of forklocal is the *max* number of child forks that can exist (plus
or minus a few). for example, if you set FORK_LOCAL=25 in your asimrc,
asim-run will allow up to 25 simultaneous benchmark setups at once. this will
speed up submissions to netbatch and especially virtual netbatch.

NOTE: forklocal is still beta. use caution. :)

NOTE: try with lower settings of forklocal and if your machine is ok, you can
increase it. you can easily swamp your machine if you set this too high.

apm-find-relace was updated with enhanced filtering capabilities
and the ability to rename models.

The semantics of find_module_{providing,requiring}() in Asim::Model
and Asim::Module have changed to not include searching of the
modules in a submodel. To get the previous behavior one much first
invoke emded_submodles on the model. The only script that actually
relied on the old semantics was hasim-connect, and it has been
updated.

did a *lot* of cleanup in asim-run. the major changes include the explicit
passing of variables to functions so that we can avoid all the problems of

that i am aware of. both local build and batch build modes seem to work great
now. <fingers_crossed> also, i fixed the "use of unitialized variables" in
PutEnv. the rest of the changes are just cleanup.

added WARN and WARNX to mesg.h. these macros are like ASSERT but they do not

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2367 - Carl Beckmann)

- Fixed the "branch package" command for SVN packages in asim-shell.
The semantics are a little different than the old CVS version of this command.
You used to have to commit all your changes before creating a branch,
and now you can create a branch even if you have uncommitted changes in
your working copy. Your working copy will be switched over to the new
branch, and your uncommitted changes will still be there.

Also, you can now create a branch from another branch.

Unlike the old CVS version, your admin/packages file will *not* be
renamed to the new branch name, nor will you get a new CSN series starting
at 1. This is because CSN numbers track the SVN revision numbers, which are
global across the trunk and all branches (unlike CVS where they were
hierarchical).

As a BKM for creating branches, I would like to suggest using all upper case,
with a short descriptive title and a date.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2388 - Brian Slechta)

augmented the DRAL/PTV API to support reference counting on event records.
this uses the existing ptlib reference counting feature. you can use
reference counting to allow multiple objects share the same PTV record. for
example, a cbox message can share the parent idi message's ptv record. here
is an example using the ASIM_ITEM_CLASS API in item.h.

IDI_MSG_CLASS::IDI_MSG_CLASS(...)
{
EVENT(OpenEventRec());
}

IDI_MSG_CLASS::~IDI_MSG_CLASS()
{
EVENT(CloseEventRec());
}

CBOX_MSG_CLASS::CBOX_MSG_CLASS(IDI_MSG_CLASS *idi_msg, ...)
{
// this is the prefered method of inheriting ptv events.
EVENT(RefEventRec(idi_msg));

// *** OR ***

// this is another way to slice it, though not preferred.
// users should not play with ids from the api.
UINT32 did = idi_msg->GetRecId();
EVENT(RefEventRec(did));

// *** OR ***

// alternatively, this is the hackish way of doing it
// this is not good. and you should not close the record
// in the destructor. this can cause lots of issues
// if the idi_msg dies before the cbox_msg
EVENT(SetRecId(idi_msg->GetRecId()));
}

CBOX_MSG_CLASS::CBOX_MSG_CLASS(IDI_MSG_CLASS *idi_msg, ...)
{
// must close when using RecEventRec(). do *not* use this
// if you just manually set the id via SetRecId().
EVENT(CloseEventRec());
}

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2395 - Carl Beckmann)

- Implemented a "update bundle" command in asim-shell, that honors
version tags containing either CSN numbers or SVN branch or tag
specifiers, to give you functionality akin to CVS "sticky tags".
For example, if you define a bundle that uses specific stable versions
of certain packages, you can "update bundle <bundle>/<tag>" and always
get exactly those versions (it will not clobber them with the latest
version). this is useful if you want to define a bundle where one or
two packages are at HEAD and will get updated, and the others are at
specific versions and will stay stable.

You can also use "update bundle" to switch to a branch (i.e. a bundle
containing one or more packages on a branch), or to switch from the branch
back to the trunk. "Update bundle" is smart enough to use the "svn switch"
command instead of "svn update" when changing between branches/tags or
the trunk of repository.

Also cleaned up a few minor code and documentation issues in the
perl modules.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2402 - Carl Beckmann)

- Added the ability in SVN packages and bundles to check out or update to
a specific version along a branch. This capability evidently already
existed for CVS packages, and the SVN implementation is compatible with it,
at least in spirit. The following syntax is now supported for tags in
asim-shell package commands, and in bundle specifications:

HEAD - the latest revision on the main trunk
<branchname> - the latest revision on the named branch
CSN-<package>-<number> - a specific revision on the main trunk
CSN-<branchname>-<number> - a specific revision on a branch
<number> - a specific revision on the main trunk
<branchname>:<number> - a specific revision on a branch

Note that unlike in CVS where CSN numbers started at 1 again with each branch,
in SVN the branch shares the same revision number space with the main trunk,
so the numbers keep incrementing, and the branch is simply distinguished
by <branchname>.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2406 - Krishna Rangan)

- added a tag to supply special include arguments used in
compilation. This implementation is specific; a generic
method to feed in special compiler flags and options with
or without file args would be useful.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2407 - Abhishek Bhattacharjee)

Changes made to accomodate integrated power macro calls in ports for
models using the power infrastructure. In port.h, the access type of
the private members in ReadPort, WritePort, ReadSkidPort,
WriteSkidPort etc. are changed to protected. This is so that the
PowerReadPort, PowerWritePort etc. classes in the asim-power package
derived from the classes in port.h have access to those members as
well.
null_power_model.h has been modified to include the null model for the
power ports.

Updating with simcore changes (rev. 2422 - Angshuman Parashar)

Added support for a new AWB directive %sources, which is
used to specify list(s) of source files for a module. The
directive takes two switches: '-t' specifies the type of
source file (e.g., CPP, VERILOG, VHDL, BSV, etc.), and
'-v' specifies the visibility of the list of files (PUBLIC
or PRIVATE).

Example usage:
    %sources -t CPP -v PRIVATE foo.cpp bar.cpp baz.cpp
    %sources -t CPP -v PUBLIC  foo.h bar.h

The directives %private and %public are now deprecated.
However, for backward compatibility with existing .awb
files and with tools such as apm-edit, these directives,
as well as the Module.pm interfaces public() and private()
continue to work, although they are inefficient since they
are implemented as wrappers around the %sources framework.
Module writers and tool writers are encouraged to use the
new directive/interfaces.
