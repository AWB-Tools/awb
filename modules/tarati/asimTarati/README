==============================================================================

The code in this directory implements the linkage between an ASIM system
and the Tarati (ASIM external interface) server.

For more information on Tarati, see the tarati directory.

What is it
----------

The ASIM Tarati linkage implements helpers for interfacing an ASIM system
to a Tarati server, e.g. registration of ASIM's Tarati Services. It also
contains the code for the Services themselves.
ASIM Tarati implements the following abstractions:

System:
  The ASIM System - Tarati Server interface class with a small, well
  defined interface:
    // constructor
    AsimTaratiSystem (ASIM_SYSTEM system);
    // check for work
    void Work(void);
  The AsimTaratiSystem class registers/unregisters all ASIM Tarati
  Services on startup/shutdown and allows the Tarati Server to get control
  during normal operation if there is some work for it to be done.

Services and Methods:
  All ASIM Tarati Services (subclassed from Service) and their
  associated Methods (subclassed from Method) are implemented here.
  This is the code that provides assess to ASIM's functionality via the
  Tarati interface.
