Most of the Asim scripts are executed using 'asimstarter' as a trampoline 
to allow a user to use an updated version of their scripts instead of the
globally installed version. Thus adding a script is a little more complicated
than usual. To add an asim script, e.g., 'new-asim-util', here one must do
the following:

  1) Create the script 'new-asim-util' here
  2) Do a 'cvs add new-asim-util'
  3) Add a new tool line to 'asimstarter.in'
  4) Add 'new-asim-util' to the tool_SCRIPTS line in Makefile.AM
  5) Do an autoconf of the package, see ../../README for instructions
  6) Do an 'awb-shell update package awb'

As a user that can install asim, e.g., root or ASIM1 here in Hudson:

  1) Use awb-shell to check out and build awb package.
  2) cd src/awb; make install
