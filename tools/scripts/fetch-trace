# Purpose:
#       fetches trace files from the Asim trace disks in Hudson or the DPG trace
#	disks in Portland into a local trace cache, and returns the path to the
#	local files.
#	This is intended to be used in "setup" scripts invoked by benchmark .cfg
#	or .cfx scripts used by AWB and asim-run to set up benchmark traces.

=head1 NAME

fetch-trace - Utility to fetch benchmark trace files into a local disk cache

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     % fetch-trace <trace name>
          [--[no]fetch]
          [--[no]verbose]
          [--help]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Fetch-trace is used to copy benchmark trace files into a local disk accessible
by Asim model runs.  The traces could be in a remote file system, in which case
they are rsync'ed to the local disk.  The use of fetch-trace allows benchmark
configuration scripts to be written in a site-independent manner.

Fetch-trace is given a trace name as an argument.  This name can be either the
absolute path to the trace, or a simple name.  If it is a simple name, fetch-trace
first looks up the name in various "trace list" files to determine its absolute
path.  If the resulting file is not available locally, it looks in the local trace
cache, and if it cannot find it there, it rsync's it from the remote site.

Fetch-trace returns the absolute path to the local copy of the desired traces
(which is usually a prefix of the actual file names).

Fetch-trace is similar in spirit to DPG's fetch_trace (note the underscore), and
in fact calls fetch_trace to retrieve traces on DPG's trace disk.  Fetch-trace
adds the following features to fetch_trace:

=over 4 

=item

Can fetch traces from not only the DPG disks, but also the Asim trace disks.

=item

Is configurable by system and user asimrc files.

=item

Can be used not only to fetch traces, but also to look up the location of traces
by consulting trace list (tlist) files.

=back

=head1 SWITCHES

The following command line switches are currently supported:

=over 4 

=item --[no]fetch

Specifies whether or not to fetch the trace.  If not, it only looks up
and returns the absolute path name of the trace on its server.

=item --[no]verbose

Specified that extra information should be printed. The [no] prefix
reverses the sense of the command. Default is NOT to be verbose.

=item --help

Get this help information.

=back

=head1 USAGE MODEL

In its simplest usage, fetch-trace can be used as an improved version of
(or rather, a wrapper around) DPG's fetch_trace script.
In this mode, you supply fetch-trace with the absolute path name (on the server)
of the desired trace, and fetch-trace copies the files, if necessary,
into the local cache.  It's last line of output is the path name on the local
machine, but may be preceded by debugging output lines starting with "#",
which can be filtered as in the following example:

=over 4

#!/bin/sh

local_path=`fetch-trace /trace/path/prefix | tail -1`

=back

It can also be used to look up the absolute path of the trace on the server,
given just the trace name, as follows:

=over 4

abspath=`fetch-trace --nofetch tracename | tail -1`

=back

Both of these functions can be combined by omitting the --nofetch argument,
and simply supplying a trace name.  In this case, fetch-trace tries to find
the trace as described in ALGORITHM below, and fetches the needed files
into the local trace cache as needed, returning the local absolute path:

=over 4

local_path=`fetch-trace tracename | tail -1`

=back

Typically, fetch-trace is invoked from the "setup" script called by Asim
benchmark CFG files or CFX scripts, when copying (soft links to) trace files
into the user's experiment run directories.

=head1 ALGORITHM

Fetch-trace performs one or both of the following two steps
(depending on arguments) in the following order:

=head2 Trace Location Lookup

If only a name (not an absolute path) is supplied as the trace argument,
fetch-trace first tries to determine the location of the trace.
It does so by searching trace list (.tlist) files in the following order:

=over 4

=item

in the DPG_MASTER_TLIST file

=item

in the ASIM_MASTER_TLIST file

=back

=head2 Trace caching

Once it has an absolute path to the trace (either by Trace Location Lookup,
or from the command line), fetch-trace performs trace caching
by following the steps below:

=over 4

=item

If the absolute path matches the regular expression DPG_TRACE_PATTERN,
then fetch-trace invokes DPG_FETCH_TRACE to cache the trace, and exits.

=item

Otherwise, if any trace files exist with the given absolute path as a prefix,
then fetch-trace assumes nothing else needs to be done,
so it prints the absolute path and exits.

=item

Otherwise, it looks in the local ASIM_TRACE_CACHE directory for any files
that match the absolute path as a prefix (without the enclosing directory),
and if it finds any, it prints their location in the ASIM_TRACE_CACHE
directory and exists.

=item

Otherwise, it uses rsync to copy any files with the absolute path as a prefix
from the machine ASIM_TRACE_SERVER into the local directory ASIM_TRACE_CACHE,
and prints their location in the ASIM_TRACE_CACHE directory.

=back

=head1 ASIMRC CONFIGURATION SETTINGS

The following parameters can be set in the system or user asimrc files
to control fetch-trace's behavior:

=over 4

=item DPG_MASTER_TLIST

This is the absolute path to the DPG master trace list file,
which is searched for the location of traces accessible via DPG_FETCH_TRACE.
If this is set to the empty string,
then only the ASIM_MASTER_TLIST file is searched.

=item ASIM_MASTER_TLIST

This is the absolute path to the Asim master trace list file,
which is searched for the location of all other traces.

=item DPG_TRACE_PATTERN

A regular expression to recognize DPG trace file absolute paths.
For example: "^\/fs..\/(psc|wmt|nhm)\.arch\.traces.*/traces".
If this is set to ".*",
then DPG fetch_trace is used exclusively to fetch all traces
(although the ASIM_MASTER_TLIST file may still be used for lookup).

=item DPG_FETCH_TRACE

The trace fetch program for DPG traces,
usually "fetch_trace" or "/nfs/site/proj/dpg/arch/bin/fetch_trace".
If this is set to the empty string,
then DPG fetch_trace is not used
(although the DPG_MASTER_TLIST file may still be used for lookup).

=item ASIM_TRACE_CACHE

Location of the local disk cache for Asim traces.

=item ASIM_TRACE_SERVER

The server to rsync Asim traces from, e.g. "asim.intel.com".

=back

=head1 SEE ALSO

perldoc /nfs/site/proj/dpg/arch/bin/fetch_trace

=head1 BUGS

The Tlist file parsing is currently very ad hoc.
It should be generalized, and put in a reusable perl module.

Cache cleanup of the ASIM_LOCAL_CACHE directory, in the case of overflow,
has not yet been implemented.

There is no error checking of the rsync command to make sure
that it transferred the files ok into the local Asim cache directory.
