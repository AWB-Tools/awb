=head1 NAME

plot-shell - Shell to read, print, and plot ASIM stats

=head1 SYNOPSIS

plot-shell [--basedir <base directory for all experiments>]
           [--experiments <one or more experiments to analyze>]
           [--benchmarks <one or more benchmarks per experiment>] 
           [--params <one or more parameters per benchmark>] 
           [--file <commandfile for batch mode operation>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

plot-shell provides a command line interface to extract, print or plot 
statistics for ASIM runs.  The command line provides some initial default
values, and the values can be further augmented or manipulated using the "set" 
command. Use the command "help" to list the individual commands.

If Text::ReadLine::Gnu is installed then command line completion will
be available inside the shell.

=head1 SWITCHES

The following command line switches are currently supported:

=over 4 

=item --basedir <basedir>

Look in the directory given for all the experiments.  This provides a base 
location for all the experiments and benchmarks you would like to look at. 
By default, the basedir is set to AWBLOCAL if the environment variable exists. 

=item --experiments <experiments>

Evaluate statistics over the following set of one or more experiments.  Each
experiment represents one configuration of the simulated machine.  plot-shell
expects to see a directory for each of the experiments in the basedir. 

=item --benchmarks <benchmarks>

Evaluate statistics for the given set of benchmarks.  The program grabs 
the requested parameters for each of the benchmarks.  

=item --params <params>

Set One or more parameters to evaluate in the stats files. 

=item --batch

Run the script in batch mode. This mostly means that defaults will be
provided for interactive inputs. 

=item --file <commandfile>

Read commands from <commandfile>. Use '-' to read commands from
STDIN. When this option is used the command on the command line is
ignored.

=item --help

Get this help information.

=head1 EXAMPLES

    % plot-shell help quickstart

    % plot-shell
#    asim> set model pm/Arana/arana_aint_dev.apm
#    asim> clean model
#    asim> configure model
#    asim> build model
#    asim> run model bm/Micro/maxipc.cfg
#    asim> quit
#
#
#    % asim-shell --package=arana commit package
#
#
#    % asim-shell help
#
#    % asim-shell help code


=head1 BUGS

The asim perl libraries must be in your perl path or the 'use AsimShell'
statement won\'t work. The easiest way to make this true is to invoke
asim-shell through asimstarter....you can also set the environment
variable PERL5LIB.

Maybe the command line format should allow one to specify commands
with a '-e' switch and a bare word is a file to read commands from.

Maybe asim-shell should also parse an environment variable and/or
.rc file for switches.

Asim-shell depends on the 'etc' directory being at $AWBSYSTEM/etc, 
while ./configure could have put it somewhere else. We need to have
a way of communicating where all the pieces of asim are not just
the root.
