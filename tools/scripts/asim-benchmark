=head1 NAME

Asim-shell - Shell to manipulate ASIM objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

asim-shell [--workspace <workspace>]
           [--package <package>]
           [--model <model>] 
           [--benchmark <benchmark>] 
           [--module <module>] 
           [--repositoryDB <repositoryDB>] 
           [--file <commandfile>]
           [[--] command...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a program that provides a command line interface to manipulate
various ASIM objects.  The command line provides initial default
values for various objects that can be manipulated. The "set" command can
be used to set or reset these values. Use the command
"help" to list the individual commands.

If Text::ReadLine::Gnu is installed then command line completion will
be available inside the shell.

=head1 SWITCHES

The following command line switches are currently supported:

=over 4 

=item --workspace <workspace>

Set current workspace to be rooted at the directory <workspace>. Impliclty
this sets the environment variable $AWBLOCAL to be <workspace> and the
file $AWBLOCAL/awb.config must exist.

=item --package <package>

Set the current package, i.e., a checked out repository, to be <package>.
Package names are divined from the files in the AWB search path at 
admin/packages/*, by convention these are frequently found at $AWBLOCAL/src/.

=item --model <model>

Set the current model to <model>, where <model> is a model
configuration file (.apm). Defaults to environment variable $AWB_MODEL if set.

=item --benchmark <benchmark>

Set the current benchmark to <benchmark>, where <benchmark> is a benchmark
configuration file (.cfg). Defaults to environment variable $AWB_BENCHMARK if set.


=item --module <module>

Set the current module to <module>, where <module> is a model .awb file.

=item --repositoryDB <repositoryDB>

Set the source for the information on available repositories to
<repositoryDB>, which must point at a .pack file.

=item --batch

Run the script in batch mode. This mostly means that defaults will be
provided for interactive inputs. Some defaults are, however, not
identical to the interctive defaults, e.g., "Last chance - do you want
to continue" questions will be ansered "yes", rather than "no".

=item --interactive

Reverse of --batch. This is the default.


=item --file <commandfile>

Read commands from <commandfile>. Use '-' to read commands from
STDIN. When this option is used the command on the command line is
ignored.

=item --help

Get this help information.

=item [--] command...

An asim-shell command. A summary of asim-shell commands can be
obtained by invoking the 'help' command, e.g., 'asim-shell
help'. Information on the various objects supported can be obtained by
invoking the command 'help abstractions';

Note that for asim-shell commands with options themselves the "--" in
front of the command is not optional.

=back


=head1 EXAMPLES

    % asim-shell help quickstart

    % asim-shell
    asim> set model pm/Arana/arana_aint_dev.apm
    asim> clean model
    asim> configure model
    asim> build model
    asim> run model bm/Micro/maxipc.cfg
    asim> quit


    % asim-shell --package=arana commit package


    % asim-shell help

    % asim-shell help code


=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

AWBLOCAL - this variable defines the root directory of your workspace
and is needed for asim-shell to function. It is normally set
automatically by asimstarter.Setting it explicitly is discouraged.

ASIMSHELLOPT - contains additional command line switches.

=head1 FILES

~/.asim/asimrc - user-specific configuration file

INSTALLPREFIX/etc/asim/asimrc - global configuration file

~/.asim/asim.pack - user-specific description of repositories (optional)

INSTALLPREFIX/etc/asim/asim.pack - global description of repositories, which 
is used if ~/.asim/asim.pack does not exist.


=head1 BUGS

The asim perl libraries must be in your perl path or the 'use AsimShell'
statement won\'t work. The easiest way to make this true is to invoke
asim-shell through asimstarter....you can also set the environment
variable PERL5LIB.

Maybe the command line format should allow one to specify commands
with a '-e' switch and a bare word is a file to read commands from.

Maybe asim-shell should also parse an environment variable and/or
.rc file for switches.

Asim-shell depends on the 'etc' directory being at $AWBSYSTEM/etc, 
while ./configure could have put it somewhere else. We need to have
a way of communicating where all the pieces of asim are not just
the root.
