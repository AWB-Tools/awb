To add a new tool, e.g, <mytool> do the following:

   1) Add tool's directory as tools/<mytool> and copy your sources into
      it.

   2) Add <mytool> to the SUBDIRS variable in tools/Makefile.am
      Note: if <mytool> is not a direct subdirectory of tools, add
            each directory of the <mytool> path to the appropriate
            Makefile.am under the tools/* directory tree. E.g. if
            <mytool> = lib/libawb
            you need to make sure that tools/Makefile.am has an entry
            SUBDIRS = ... lib ...
            and tools/lib/Makefile.am has an entry
            SUBDIRS = ... libawb ...

   3) Add a tools/<mytool>/Makefile.am automake file;
      look for an example in tools/lib/libawb or tools/awb/amc;

   4) Add tools/<mytool>/Makefile to the list of Makefiles in
      tools/../configure.in AC_CONFIG_FILES(...)

   5) To generate the appropriate Makefile.in files, run the following
      command in the top level directory:
        csh> pwd
        .../asim-core
        csh> automake --foreign tools/<mytool>/Makefile

   6) Configure the package in maintainer mode, so the rest of the
      prebuilt makefile infrastructure will be updated as necessary.
      You need to be on the top level for this.
        csh> pwd
        .../asim-core
        csh> ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
        csh> make
      This should have taken care of updating any necessary files required
      for make to work properly with <mytool>. You are done with updating
      the Makefile infrastructue.

   7) Now you can iron out any problems you might have encountered when
      trying to build <mytool> itself.



Which files should get added to CVS (with cvs add) before commiting?

  Add the following types of files:
    * configure.in
    * Makefile.am
    * Makefile.in
    * any file that is created by automake and autoconf

  DO NOT add the following types of files:
    * Makefile
    * any file that is created by ./configure
