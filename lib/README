The structure of the library directories is such

lib/libname/src - source (.cpp) files

lib/libname/include/asim - header files


When you include the header files in any file, make sure it's of this form:

#include "asim/header.h"

and then have the following switch in the compile line:

-Ilib/libname/include


The makefiles expect to look for header files in an asim directory, and if
you decide to not follow the convention, life will become more difficult for
you, your library, and me.  Thank you.
