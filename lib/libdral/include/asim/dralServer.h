 * @class DRAL_SERVER_CLASS
 * This class mission is to help developers with the generation of DRAL 2.0 trace files.
 * Every object of this class writes dral events into a single file. Although one program may 
 * have more than one dralServer object.
 * 
 * A Dral server does not only provide a list of calls that get 
 * translated into dral 2.0 command bit encodings, it has some goodies:
 * - Use of buffered writing to minimize write system calls
 * - Automatic compression of output files
 * - Start and stop writing at user convenience (Turn on and off a dralServer)
 * - Possibility of closing the output file and continue writing into a new file (only when the server is turned off) 
 * - Dral server is able to remember dral commands used when its turned off, and the write them 
 *   All when it is turned on again (only for those commands that are persistent)
 * For more explanation about DRAL 2.0 \see Dral 2.0 Documentation.
 * 
 * @brief Dral server mission is to write DRAL-Language trace files.
