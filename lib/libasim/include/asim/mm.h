/**
 * @brief simple reference counting, memory debugging class
 *
 * This class provides support for reference counting, memory allocation,
 * and memory debugging. We'll call a class M that is derived from
 * ASIM_MM_CLASS<M> also a "MM class", and its objects are called "MM
 * objects" for short.
 *
 * - Reference Counting:
 *   ASIM_MM_CLASS is a templated base class for objects that require
 *   reference counting for correct operation. For an MM class, it is
 *   not necessary to call the delete operator on its objects.
 *   Instead, the object will automatically be deleted when there are
 *   no more references to it (this is done by reference counting,
 *   not liveness analysis and garbage collection like in Java).
 *
 * - Memory Allocation:
 *   Deleted objects are kept on a free list in order to avoid the
 *   malloc/free overhead for the storage associated with the object.
 *   When an object is newed, the storage for the object is taken off
 *   the free list. However, newed objects do execute their associated
 *   constructor in the normal way. @note The object's destructor is
 *   called only immediately before the storage is reassigned to a new
 *   object from the free list, NOT as one might assume, when the
 *   object gets put onto the freelist. This has only implications if
 *   you are trying to do something interesting in the destructor,
 *   like stats keeping.
 *
 * - Memory Debugging:
 *   MM classes must declare the maximum number of objects of their type
 *   that can be in use an any time.  The ASIM_MM_CLASS will make sure
 *   that this limit can not be exceeded, providing a relatively fast
 *   detection of memory leaks.  When accessing MM objects in code
 *   compiled for debug, the validity of the access is checked by
 *   making sure the object has a reference count > 0. While compiled
 *   for debug the MM objects also carry a unique ID "mmUid" and the
 *   particular MM class carries a class name string. These fields can
 *   assist in debugging memory problems, by allowing each MM object
 *   to be easily uniquely identified. In addition, in debug mode MM object
 *   references check that they are references to the correct type by
 *   making sure the object carries a key (mmMagicKey) that
 *   corresponds to the object type they are supposed to represent.
 *   For performance reasons, many of the debugging features are not
 *   compiled in for non-debug compilation.
