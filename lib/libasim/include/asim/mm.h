/*
Original mmptr code would break when running in multiple threads [1]: it's too
easy to assign one object to n different threads and not track it appropriately.
To fix this, we can split shared structures into MAX_PTHREADS pools and use an
ATOMIC_CLASS reference count. This causes each thread to be allocated objects from
distinct pools (thus no locking is required).

The freelist, however, must be locked to handle object deletion.  For recycling,
they must be placed on the original owner's freelist, but they may be deleted by
a different thread.  TODO: It's probably that it -will- be the owner who is the last
reference; can we exploit this?  (if (get_asim_thread_id == obj->ownerThread) {
no lock needed? } )

Handling destruction of statics is a mess.  Write a good destructor and see
comments in LastRefDropped()

1. in this context, "threads" means -real- threads (pthreads) on the machine hosting
the simulator, NOT software contexts.

/**
 * @brief simple reference counting, memory debugging class
 *
 * This class provides support for reference counting, memory allocation,
 * and memory debugging. We'll call a class M that is derived from
 * ASIM_MM_CLASS<M,L> also a "MM class", and its objects are called "MM
 * objects" for short.
 *
 * - Reference Counting:
 *   ASIM_MM_CLASS is a templated base class for objects that require
 *   reference counting for correct operation. For an MM class, it is
 *   not necessary to call the delete operator on its objects.
 *   Instead, the object will automatically be deleted when there are
 *   no more references to it (this is done by reference counting,
 *   not liveness analysis and garbage collection like in Java).
 *
 * - Memory Allocation:
 *   Deleted objects are kept on a free list in order to avoid the
 *   malloc/free overhead for the storage associated with the object.
 *   When an object is newed, the storage for the object is taken off
 *   the free list. However, newed objects do execute their associated
 *   constructor in the normal way. @note The object's destructor is
 *   called only immediately before the storage is reassigned to a new
 *   object from the free list, NOT as one might assume, when the
 *   object gets put onto the freelist. This has only implications if
 *   you are trying to do something interesting in the destructor,
 *   like stats keeping.
 *
 * - Memory Debugging:
 *   MM classes must declare the maximum number of objects of their type
 *   that can be in use an any time.  The ASIM_MM_CLASS will make sure
 *   that this limit can not be exceeded, providing a relatively fast
 *   detection of memory leaks.  When accessing MM objects in code
 *   compiled for debug, the validity of the access is checked by
 *   making sure the object has a reference count > 0. While compiled
 *   for debug the MM objects also carry a unique ID "mmUid" and the
 *   particular MM class carries a class name string. These fields can
 *   assist in debugging memory problems, by allowing each MM object
 *   to be easily uniquely identified. In addition, in debug mode MM object
 *   references check that they are references to the correct type by
 *   making sure the object carries a key (mmMagicKey) that
 *   corresponds to the object type they are supposed to represent.
 *   For performance reasons, many of the debugging features are not
 *   compiled in for non-debug compilation.
