This diretory contains an Asim Perl module. Normally
the Makefile used to create this directory will be 
created automatically by ../Makefile, and the perl 
module itself will in installed in ${prefix}/lib/perl5,
where ${prefix} is as specified at ./configure time.

See ../README for instructions on installing the
modules in a different location.

To install just one of the perl modules in a 
different place you can use the standard
perl module build procedure:

 % perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=<install prefix>
 % make
 % make install


NOTE:

When adding a module to this perl library remember
to add it to ./MANIFEST as well, or it won't get
installed.
