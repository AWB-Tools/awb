This diretory contains several subdirectoris containing
Asim Perl modules. To build those modules and
install them in the ${prefix} specified at 
./configure time, type:

  % make
  % make install

To install in a different location you can do the 
following:

 % make clean
 % make prefix=<install prefix>
 % make
 % make install


For instructions on building and installing an
individual module see the README in the module
subirectory.
