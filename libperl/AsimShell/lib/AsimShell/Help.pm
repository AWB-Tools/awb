  where,
    <workspace> is a directory containing an asim workspace

    <repository> is a repository name from a .pack file
    <tag> is a version or branch tag

    <package> is the name of a package (run 'list packages' for choices)

    <model> is a model .apm file
        default: \$AWB_MODEL or last model configured/built

    <benchmark> is a benchmark .cfg file
        default: \$AWB_BENCHARK or last benchmark setup/run

    <module> is a module .awb filename

  Note command completion and editing exists at the command prompt 
  and for most of the user input prompts. You may need to install
  the perl module Term::Readline::GNU for this to work...
  
  The <tag> argument for package commands has the following syntax and
  semantics:
  
    HEAD                       - the latest revision on the main trunk
    <branchname>               - the latest revision on the named branch
    CSN-<package>-<number>     - a specific revision on the main trunk
    CSN-<branchname>-<number>  - a specific revision on a branch
    <number>                   - a specific revision on the main trunk (SVN only)
    <branchname>:<number>      - a specific revision on a branch (SVN only)


Environment:

  ASIMSHELLOPT
    Contains additional command line switches, which are effectively
    prepended at the beginning of the command line.

  AWBLOCAL
    If AWBLOCAL is set, it is used to set the default workspace.
    AWBLOCAL must point to the directory that contains the awb.config file
    for the workspace. Using AWBLOCAL explictly is discouranged in favor
    of simply CDing into a workspace.

  AWB_MODEL
    If AWB_MODEL is set, it is used to set the default model.
    AWB_MODEL must point to a model configuration file (*.apm).

  AWB_BENCHMARK
    If AWB_BENCHMARK is set , it is used to set the default benchmark.
    AWB_BENCHMARK must point to a benchmark configuration file (*.cfg).

  ASIMEDITOR or EDITOR
    The ASIMEDITOR or EDITOR environment variable is used when a file needs 
    to be edited, e.g. the changes file during a commit procedure. If neither
    is defined emacs and gvim are tried.

  ASIMTMPDIR or TMPDIR
    Various procedures in asim-shell need to create temporary files.
    these variables point to the directory where these temporary files 
    will be created. If neither is defined /tmp will be used.

  PAGER
    If PAGER is set, its value us used as the name of the program to
    page through text output one screenful at a time. If it is not defined,
    "more" is used for paging.

  SHELL
    The SHELL environment variable is used as the program to start
    for the "shell package" command.

  CVS_RSH
    In order to start cvs commands on packages / repositories, CVS_RSH
    is used to select the correct remote connection method for cvs. If
    this variable is not set, asim-shell set a default of "ssh2" before
    any cvs commands are issued.

Files:
  ~/.asim/asimrc
    User-specific configuration file

  $Asim::sysconfdir/asim/asimrc
    Global configuration file

  ~/.asim/repositories.d/<name>.pack
    User-specific description of repositories (optional)

  ~/.asim/asim.pack
    User-specific description of repositories (deprecated/optional)

  $Asim::sysconfdir/asim/repositories.d/*.pack
    Global descriptions of repositories.

  $Asim::sysconfdir/asim/asim.pack
    More global descriptions of repositories (legacy).

  To run asim-shell (and see this information) you need to have 
  asim-shell in your path, and the environment variable \$AWBLOCAL 
  defined. If you have a "standard" asim setup the following
  should work to get you started...

  First time only
  ---------------

  For csh-like shells:

    setenv PATH $Asim::bindir:\$PATH

    asim-shell new workspace <workspace>

    cd <workspace>


  For bourne-like shells:

    export PATH=$Asim::bindir:\$PATH

    asim-shell new workspace <workspace>

    cd <workspace>

  Where:
    <workspace> is a directory to create as your new workspace



  Subsequent uses
  ---------------

  For csh-like shells:

    setenv PATH $Asim::bindir:\$PATH

    cd <workspace>


  For bourne-like shells:

    export PATH=$Asim::bindir:\$PATH

    cd <workspace>

  Where:
    <workspace> is a directory you previously created as your workspace


  Now get more help with
