# defines the type of run to perform.  For example, regression.launcher
# is used to run both general checkin regression and nightly regression.  
# The actual actual benchmarks and models to run for the given RUNTYPE

# asim-run has a built in scheduler to work around some issues with netbatch. 
# Certain pools (RESTRICTED_POOLS) and certain queues (RESTRICTED_QSLOTS) 
# are restricted, which means additional ASIM scheduling restrictions apply.  
# The scheduler forces asim-run to go to sleep for a random sleep period and 
# try again afterwards if any of the following conditions are true: 
# 
# 1.) The number of running ASIM jobs (from all ASIM users) exceeds 
#     MAX_ASIM_JOBS. 
# 2.) The specific user has more than MAX_WAITING_JOBS waiting
# 3.) The number of running jobs for the current user exceeds MAX_RUNNING_JOBS 
#     AND the user has submitted more then MAX_JOBS_PER_PERIOD
# 
# The sleep period is randomized to be a value between MIN_SAMPLE_PERIOD and
# MIN_SAMPLE_PERIOD + 1200 seconds.  
#
# If you don't want the asim-run scheduler to engage, then leave RESTRICTED_POOLS 
# and/or RESTRICTED_QSLOTS blank. Note that by default, the asim scheduler is

# 20 benchmarks, then asim-batch is invoked 20 times.  
#
# asim-batch does 4 primary tasks:
# 1.) sets up a clean, repeateable environment for running jobs so that 
#     on a failure, the failures can be repeated. 
# 2.) Keeps track of which jobs ran cleanly and which jobs failed in the
