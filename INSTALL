AWB quickstart...

AWB suports the notion of "packages" that contain the source for
either utilities or projects. For example, to use asim one must install 
at least this awb package (the one that contains this file) in either a 
system-wide place (like /usr/local or /proj/asim) or a private spot 
(like ~/asim). Shell scripts, binaries and other shared files are placed
there. After awb is installed the "awb-shell" program can
be used to access the other asim packages from their repositories.
The other packages can then be used privately by the person that checked
them out or installed in the same place as core was installed and shared
by all the users with access to them.


Prerequisites
-------------

   To run the awb tools you need:

        perl 5.6.0 or later with the following packages:
            Term:ReadLine::Gnu (optional)

        qt 3.0 or later for some gui tools
            (configure with --enable-gui=no to avoid building these tools)

        TODO: configuration instructions...


   To actually build and run models you also need:

        gcc-3.01 or later
        scons



System Installation
-------------------

   1) Unpack awb-<release>.tar.gz (the tarball containing this file)


   2) Pick a directory, which we'll call <AWBSYSTEM> to install asim - 
      something like /proj/awb or /usr/local or for a single user ~/awb.


   3) Do the following:

      % cd awb
      % ./configure --prefix=<AWBSYSTEM> [--enable-gui=no]
      % make 
      % make install
      % make install-src

      
   4) Install asim model sources from other tarballs as needed, e.g., 

      asim-feeder-<release>.tar.gz     - instruction feeders
      asim-ipf-<release>.tar.gz        - ipf machine models
      asim-nework-<release>.tar.gz     - intra-cpu network models
      


User Startup
------------
   NOTE: The following instructions use examples with packages
         that are not universally available.

   0) Make sure <AWBSYSTEM> from above is in your path

   1) Create a workspace with

       % awb-shell new workspace ~/awb-dev

   2a) Add a shared model package to your work space

       % awb-shell add public_package
       [1] core/HEAD
       [2] core/core-V1_2
       [3] feeder/HEAD
       [4] feeder/feeder-V1_2
       [5] ipf/HEAD
       [6] ipf/ipf-V1_0
       [7] network/HEAD
       Select public package to add to path []: 5
       Checking package dependency: feeder/HEAD
       A package (feeder/HEAD) we depend on is not available
       Would you like to use the global version [no]?: yes
       Checking package dependency: core/HEAD

   or 

   2b) Check out a model into your workspace

       % awb-shell checkout package
       [1] core/HEAD
       [2] core/core-V1_2
       [3] feeder/HEAD
       [4] feeder/feeder-V1_2
       [5] ipf/HEAD
       [6] ipf/ipf-V1_0
       [7] network/HEAD
       Pick repository []: 7
       Repostitory user you want to do the checkout (e.g., your login name) [anonymous]:
       ....
       Do you want to add it [no]?: yes


   3) Use new workspace

       % awb-shell
       awb> help

       --- try playing with the existing models

       awb> awb 

       --- try checking out model to work on (*)

       awb> checkout package asimcore
       ......
       awb> .... make source changes ....
       awb> update package asimcore
       ......
       awb> commit package asimcore
       ......

       --- quit and do some real work

       awb> exit
