ASIM quickstart...

Asim is comprised of a set of "packages" that contain the source for
either asim utilities or models. To use asim one must install at least
the asim "core" package (the one that contains this file) in either a 
system-wide place (like /usr/local or /proj/asim) or a private spot 
(like ~/asim). Shell scripts, binaries and other shared files are placed
there. After the asim "core" is installed the "asim-shell" program can
be used to access the other asim packages from their CVS repositories.
The other packages can then be used privately by the person that checked
them out or installed in the same place as core was installed and shared
by all the users with access to them.


Prerequisites
-------------

   To run the asim tools you need:

        perl 5.6.0 or later with the following packages:
            Bundle::libnet
            Term:ReadLine::Gnu (optional)


        tcl 8.0 exactly with the following packages:
            bwidget


        qt 3.0 or later for some gui tools
            (configure with --enable-gui=no to avoid building these tools)

        TODO: configuration instructions...


   To actually build and run models you also need:

        gcc-3.01 or later
        libxml2   XML, XPath          http://www.xmlsoft.org/
        gdome2    DOM 2.0             http://phd.cs.unibo.it/gdome2/
        gmetadom  DOM C++ bindings    http://gmetadom.sourceforge.net/



System Installation
-------------------

   1) Unpack asim-core-<release>.tar.gz (the tarball containing this file)


   2) Pick a directory, which we'll call <AWBSYSTEM> to install asim - 
      something like /proj/asim or /usr/local or for a single user ~/asim. 


   3) Do the following:

      % cd asim-core
      % ./configure --prefix=<AWBSYSTEM> [--enable-gui=no]
      % make 
      % make install

      
   4) Install asim model sources from other tarballs as needed, e.g., 

      asim-feeder-<release>.tar.gz     - instruction feeders
      asim-ipf-<release>.tar.gz        - ipf machine models
      asim-nework-<release>.tar.gz     - intra-cpu network models
      


User Startup
------------

   0) Make sure <AWBSYSTEM> from above is in your path

   1) Create a workspace with

       % asim-shell new workspace ~/asim-dev

   2a) Add a shard model package to your work space

       % asim-shell add public_package
       [1] core/HEAD
       [2] core/core-V1_2
       [3] feeder/HEAD
       [4] feeder/feeder-V1_2
       [5] ipf/HEAD
       [6] ipf/ipf-V1_0
       [7] network/HEAD
       Select public package to add to path []: 5
       Checking package dependency: feeder/HEAD
       A package (feeder/HEAD) we depend on is not available
       Would you like to use the global version [no]?: yes
       Checking package dependency: core/HEAD

   or 

   2b) Check out a model into your workspace

       % asim-shell checkout package
       [1] core/HEAD
       [2] core/core-V1_2
       [3] feeder/HEAD
       [4] feeder/feeder-V1_2
       [5] ipf/HEAD
       [6] ipf/ipf-V1_0
       [7] network/HEAD
       Pick repository []: 7
       Repostitory user you want to do the checkout (e.g., your login name) [anonymous]:
       ....
       Do you want to add it [no]?: yes


   3) Use new workspace

       % asim-shell
       asim-shell> help

       --- try playing with the existing models

       asim-shell> awb 

       --- try checking out model to work on (*)

       asim-shell> checkout package core
       ......
       asim-shell> .... make source changes ....
       asim-shell> update package core
       ......
       asim-shell> commit package core
       ......

       --- quit and do some real work

       asim-shell> exit



(*) actually checking out packages reqiures you do have set
    up your ssh keys on asim.intel.com ...see ASIM docs on 
	http://asim.intel.com
    You can save repeatedly typing your password by running under ssh-agent2.
